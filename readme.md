This is an amateur built application made for physicist to interact with TNMR Tecmag applcation easier. 
It changes the UI and ads a few default macros with possibility of creating macros manualy in python.
To run, the following requirements need to be fullfiled:

-->     TNMR application installed
-->     computer connected to tecmag readstone hardware
-->     computer connected to Oxford technologies MercuryITC and MercuryIPS (optional)
-->     installed: Python3, with modules: Numpy, Matplotlib, ctypes, threading, comtypes, tkinter, email, pytnt (fixing the source files because its outdated) and possibly some other stuff

We know it ain't pretty, its our first project, we are open to suggestions ðŸ˜Š

Yours thruthfully,
the Creators
